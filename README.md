# Cantrip

***An information assistant for tabletop role-play games.***

## About

Cantrip's vision is to produce an intuitive yet powerful character information assistant that allows easy and quick access to in-game information libraries (such as spell lists) from a variety of routes that enriches tabletop gameplay without diminishing its inherently analog appeal.

### Features
* Utilizes the Core Data framework to track complex character information as a relational database, and provide data persistence between user sessions.
* Provides easy and fast access to character information across a stack of UITableViewControllers and a customized detail view controller.
* Presents information libraries with different NSSortDescriptor options selected through a UISegmentedControl for quick browsing of large data sets.
* Automatically filters the list of gameplay spells available to the currently selected character based upon his or her specified attributes.
* Additional features will include tracking combat information, item inventory, and character growth across gameplay sessions.
